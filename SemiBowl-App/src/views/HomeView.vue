    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      This site essentially exists because I was getting tired of sites like
      Quizlet becoming increasing difficult to use on school computers, and
      because I wanted more control over how the content was displayed.

    <h3>1000Lit</h3>
    <p>
      The main reason I created this site in the first place. Essentially a
      quiz on the 1000 most frequent authors in the Quizbowl literature sphere.
      The quiz is designed to get progressively harder as it goes on, but no
      one clue should be too obscure to be useful in a real match.
