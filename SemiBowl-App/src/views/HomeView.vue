    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      This site essentially exists because I was getting tired of sites like
      Quizlet becoming increasing difficult to use on school computers, and
      because I wanted more control over how the content was displayed.
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>- Authors Quiz</h3>
    <p>
      The main reason I created this site in the first place. Essentially a quiz
      on the most frequent authors in the Quizbowl literature sphere. The quiz
      is designed to get progressively harder as it goes on, but no one clue
      should be too obscure to be useful in a real match.
    </p>
    <h2>To-Do List:</h2>
    <ol>

      <li>Make a tool to write/format quiz questions</li>
      <li>Write more questions for the author's quiz</li>
      <li>Check for bad code</li>
      <li>Work on accessibility</li>
      <li>Expand to more quiz types</li>
      <li>Possibly add science olympiad stuff</li>
