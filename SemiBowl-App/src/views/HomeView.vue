    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      A practice website for Quiz/Academic Bowl topics based upon broad
      knowledge attainment. Meant for getting practice in short timeframes or
      while at school. Mostly meant for myself and my team, but anyone may find
      some use in it
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>- Authors Quiz</h3>
    <p>
      The main reason I created this site in the first place. Essentially a quiz
      on the most frequent authors in the Quizbowl literature sphere. The quiz
      is designed to get progressively harder as it goes on, but no one clue
      should be too obscure to be useful in a real match. Currently a WIP, and
      since the questions are mostly handwritten, <i>please</i> let me know if
      there are any spelling mistakes or other errors!
    </p>
